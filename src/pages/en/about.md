Hey there 👋

If you're here, you're probably looking for real information about EVs — and maybe the Toyota bZ4X in particular.

I drive a bZ4X and use it daily, and this blog is simply a place to collect practical notes, tests, and observations from that experience. No marketing language, no brand hype — just how the car actually behaves in normal use and how Toyota's first steps into full EVs look from the driver's seat.

What you'll find here:

- **Real-world tests** – Actual energy consumption at real speeds (yes, including 120 km/h) 🔋
- **Charging reality** – Where charging is smooth, and where it's… not.
- **Mods & accessories** – What's useful, what's unnecessary, and what complicates things.
- **Updates & changes** – OTA updates and other changes that affect day-to-day driving.
- **Home Assistant automations** – Smart home integrations, charging automations, and practical solutions for daily use.

## Why the bZ4X?

bZ4X appeared in my life partly out of sentiment, partly out of curiosity. Good memories of the Corolla played a role, so now it was time to check if the electric Toyota is still the "same" Toyota I know and like, or maybe a completely new story.
